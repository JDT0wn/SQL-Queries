<h1>SQL-Queries</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab I show how I created a SQL Query to filter the log_in _attempts table for failed login attempts.  

1. In the 1st query I used the [*] to return all data from the table so that i could make a decision on the easiest way to sort my information. 

2. Afterwards I decide to sort the information by login date so that I have a clearer picture of the activity on a certain timeframe.

3. Next I order the info by login date, and login time so that my information is in chronological order, and i can view the failed login attempts and by which user.
